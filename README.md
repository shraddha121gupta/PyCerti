# PyCerti
Generate certificates (or any image) with text written as per your need (and mail them too for you if you want). 
Just place a certificate template, font file (.ttf) and an excel sheet(.xlsx)(to retrieve information) in the same directory as that of script. Go through the code and check comments to know how to use the script.
Also you can use mailNow method which will mail the file to the mail to the address you want.
PS - I made this script to generate and mail participation and winning certificates for college events. Use this if you are too lazy to do it manually.
